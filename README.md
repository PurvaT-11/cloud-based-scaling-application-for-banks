# AWS Auto-Scaling Banking Application Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to my first cloud project! In this project, I explored the **AWS Cloud** to simulate how traffic is managed and scaled in large applications. I chose the **banking sector** as the domain for this simulation, driven by curiosity about how these large-scale applications handle unpredictable spikes in traffic. 

The goal of this project was to learn how to leverage AWS services like **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)**, **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**, and **EC2 Launch Templates** to build a system that can automatically scale based on real-time traffic. By implementing this project, I got hands-on experience with core AWS tools and understood how they work together to ensure high availability and reliability in applications.

## Project Motivation

As cloud-based services continue to dominate, the ability to scale efficiently and handle spikes in traffic is essential. I was particularly interested in understanding:
- How **traffic distribution** works in large-scale applications.
- How **auto-scaling** ensures that the right amount of compute resources are available during peak demand.
- How applications, like those in the banking sector, maintain their availability, reliability, and security under fluctuating loads.

For this reason, I simulated a **banking application** where:
- **Banking services** need to be highly available (e.g., payment processing, account updates).
- The system needs to automatically scale based on demand.
- I could test how AWS handles spikes and traffic distribution efficiently.

## Features

This project simulates an **auto-scaling banking application** built using the following AWS services:

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Responsible for distributing incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances, ensuring no single instance gets overwhelmed.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic load, scaling out (adding more instances) during high traffic and scaling in (removing instances) when demand decreases.
- **Launch Template**: Defines the configuration for the EC2 instances, ensuring all instances are launched with consistent settings.
- **Backend Services**: Simulated banking services (like **payment processing** and **billing**) are handled by different instances.

## Documentation

The project is documented in detail in the attached **PDF report**, which explains the architecture, components, deployment procedures, security considerations, and more. The report is designed to provide a comprehensive view of how the system works and the AWS services used in the implementation.

- [AWS Auto-Scaling Banking Application Report](AWS_Auto_Scaling_Banking_Application_Report.pdf)

### Included in the PDF Report:
1. **System Architecture**: High-level diagram of how traffic flows through the system.
2. **Component Specifications**: Details about ALB, ASG, Launch Templates, and their configurations.
3. **Service Architecture**: Overview of backend services like payment and billing.
4. **Deployment Procedures**: Step-by-step guide to deploy the application and set up AWS services.
5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Key metrics to monitor and how to ensure system health.
6. **Security Considerations**: Steps taken to secure the application and data.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2**: To create scalable virtual machines (instances) that run the application.
- **AWS Auto Scaling**: To ensure the right number of EC2 instances are available based on demand.
- **AWS Application Load Balancer**: For distributing incoming traffic to ensure optimal performance.
- **AWS Launch Templates**: To create a standardized configuration for launching EC2 instances.
- **Amazon RDS**: For database management (used in backend services).

## Why the Banking Sector?

I chose the **banking sector** for this project because it’s an industry where high availability and reliability are critical. Banks must manage a huge volume of transactions, especially during peak hours. They face **traffic spikes** when customers are doing things like online payments, transfers, or checking balances.

This project allowed me to simulate these conditions on a small scale, testing how auto-scaling and load balancing would handle such spikes in a real-world banking application scenario.

## Next Steps

This was just the first step in exploring cloud architecture and scaling techniques. In the future, I plan to:
- Add more detailed **backend services** like payment gateways and authentication systems.
- Improve the **frontend** to provide a more interactive user experience (currently a basic simulation).
- Integrate **logging and monitoring** for better insights into performance and scaling behavior.
- Complete the integration of **Amazon Lex** and **Polly** to create the chatbot with multi-language support.

## Conclusion

This project gave me a foundational understanding of how large-scale cloud applications manage traffic, scale with demand, and maintain high availability. I’m excited to continue learning and building on this knowledge to develop more advanced cloud-based systems.
